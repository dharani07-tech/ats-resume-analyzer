* **Compatibility Scoring:** Provides a percentage score indicating how well the resume matches the job description requirements.
* **Keyword Analysis:** Highlights missing, matched, and excessive keywords compared to the job description.
* **Actionable Feedback:** Suggests improvements for structure, formatting, and content relevancy.
* **Powered by AI/ML:** Uses advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for accurate text comparison.
